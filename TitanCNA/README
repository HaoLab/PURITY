TITAN is a probabilistic framework for predicting regions of copy number alterations (LOH) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events in tumour whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. The model simultaneously estimates the cellular prevalence, proportion of tumour sample containing the event, and clonal cluster memberships;

  The Y-axis is based on log ratios. Log ratios are computed ratios between normalized tumour and normal read depths. Data points close to 0 represent diploid, above 0 are copy gains, below 0 are deletions. Bright Green - HOMD、Green - DLOH、Blue - HET,NLOH、Dark Red - GAIN、Red - ASCNA, UBCNA, BCNA.

*_LOH.pdf
  The Y-axis is based on allelic ratios. Allelic ratios are computed as RefCount/Depth. Data points close to 1 represent homozygous reference base, close to 0 represent homozygous non-reference base, and close to 0.5 represent heterozygous. Normal contamination influences the divergence away from 0.5 for LOH events.Grey - HET, BCNA、Bright Green - HOMD、Green - DLOH, ALOH、Blue - NLOH、Dark Red - GAIN、Red -ASCNA, UBCNA.

  The Y-axis is the cellular prevalence that includes the normal proportion. Therefore, the cellular prevalence here refers to the proportion in the sample (including normal). Lines are drawn for each data point indicating the cellular prevalence. Heterozygous diploid are not shown because it is a normal genotype and is not categorized as being subclonal (this means 100% of cells are normal). The black horizontal line represents the tumour content labeled as "T". Each horizontal grey line represents the cellular prevalence of the clonal clusters labeled as Z1, Z2, etc. Colours are the sames for allelic ratio plots.

  Colours have the same definition as for the allelic ratio plots.
